## 📝 Introduction

The **Spam Email Classifier** project uses NLP and machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content. This helps filter unwanted emails and enhances user experience and security in email systems.



## 📊 Dataset

* **Source:** Spam Collection Dataset
* **Link:** [SMS Spam Collection Dataset]()
* **Attributes:**

| Feature | Description                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| label   | spam or ham (not spam)                |
| message | The email or SMS text message content |



## 🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Load and explore the spam dataset

✅ Preprocess text data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)

✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

✅ Build classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)

✅ Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

✅ Predict spam status for new email content



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK / SpaCy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook



## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam_email_classifier.git
cd spam_email_classifier
```

2. **Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## ▶️ Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook Spam_Email_Classifier.ipynb
```

2. **Follow the notebook steps to:**

* Explore and preprocess the dataset
* Perform text cleaning, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization
* Convert text to numerical features using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF
* Train and evaluate classification models
* Predict spam or ham for new email input



## 🏗️ Model Building

The following models were implemented and compared:

| Model                            | Description                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Multinomial Naive Bayes**      | Effective baseline for text classification |
| **Logistic Regression**          | Linear classifier with probability outputs |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Effective for high-dimensional text data   |
| **Random Forest**                | Ensemble tree-based model                  |

**Evaluation Metrics:**

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix

* **Accuracy:** *Value here*
* **Precision:** *Value here*
* **Recall:** *Value here*
* **F1-Score:** *Value here*

> The Multinomial Naive Bayes model achieved high performance due to its effectiveness in text classification tasks with bag-of-words features.
